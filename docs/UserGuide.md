## PowerConnect User Guide

Greetings! Welcome to PowerConnect! <br>

Looking for a simple and all in one solution for your teaching needs? Look no further. <br>


PowerConnect is a fully customized offline application for tuition and school teachers to manage students' and parents' administrative details. We are still working to scale our features so we mainly target tuition teachers currently. However, school teachers, do still give us a try. While our 
features are limited at this stage, we are working hard to scale them and be a useful tool in conjunction with [Learning Managment System (LMS)](#glossary) tools currently in the market. <br>

We aim to make PowerConnect as simple as possible for you to use with a focus on command line interface where you don't
have to navigate complex user menus to access the features you need, especially if you can type fast. <br>

Without further ado, let's get started!

**Q**: Where is the information stored?<br>
**A**: Data is stored locally in the ./data folder. The student and class information is stored in the file pcclass.json whereas the parents information is stored in parents.json

**Q**: What is CLI?<br>
**A**: Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text based user interface used to run the
program. Essentially you do not need a mouse to run this program at all!

**Q**: Do I need to pay for this product?<br>
**A**: No! We made a commitment to keep this program free for all users. Feel free to run and use our program, but remember to like, share and comment down below any feedback.

**Q**: Why is my command not working?<br>
**A**: PowerConnect is particular with the prefixes (/) and they need to be in the exact format as specified in the user guide. Don’t worry, with practice, it would be second nature to you.
